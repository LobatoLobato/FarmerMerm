ðŸŸ¡ Unlock mermciv upgrades through a station by completing "quests"
  -- Tech tree like
  -- Only wurts can use the station
  -- Can only do one quest at a time, changing quests resets the previously selected quest
  -- Can be things like giving certain items to the station, or accomplishing certain tasks, killing certain enemies etc
  -- On quest completed that point in the tech tree gets unlocked for the player, 
     so even if the station is destroyed the player will still have the tech unlocked,
     even showing up on another station.
  -- Tech unlocks are individual, so if a wurt unlocks something other wurts wont unlock it,
     ðŸŸ¡ maybe add a way to share progress with other wurts.
        -- "Learn" action in the station?
        -- Let the station be shared?
        -- Link the player to a station and every player linked to that station will share progress 
            -- being able to complete different quests simultaneously?
            -- being able to help other wurts's quests?
  -- Quests are picture books drawn by wurt  
    -- Needs specific chalk colors to be drawn
    -- books are available to be read after they are built
